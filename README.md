# Poverty-Eradication-Sponsors
To create environment free of wants, diseases, ignorance, poverty and insecurity, All community stakeholders must join hands to help the less privileged and vulnerable people in our societies, to live above poverty level. This is the concept of this repository. Poverty does not recognize race, religion, creed and nation. Most especially, in the developing countries, poverty has reduced human dignity and value thereby creating environment of insecurity and criminalities of different dimensions.
